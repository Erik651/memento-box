Dear Casey,

Congratulations on another trip around the sun! Our backyard barbecues and gardening sessions are some of my fondest memories. There's something truly special about growing your own vegetables and then enjoying them with good company. I hope your garden continues to thrive and brings you joy throughout the year.

Our movie marathons and game nights are legendary. From the intense board games to the hilarious movie choices, we've had countless nights of fun and laughter. I look forward to many more evenings filled with great entertainment and even better company. Happy birthday, Casey!

Best wishes,
Sasha

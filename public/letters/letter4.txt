Hey Casey,

Congrats on surviving another trip around the sun. Our backyard barbecues and gardening escapades are some of my fondest memories. There’s something oddly satisfying about growing your own vegetables and then grilling them while trying not to set the whole yard on fire. May your garden keep thriving and provide you with more produce than you know what to do with.

Our movie marathons and game nights are the stuff of legends. From the cutthroat board games to the cringe-worthy movie picks, we’ve had our share of ridiculous fun. Looking forward to many more evenings of questionable entertainment and dubious company. Happy birthday, Casey.

Best wishes,
Sasha

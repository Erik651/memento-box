Dear Casey,

Happy birthday! Remember that time we went hiking in the mountains and got completely lost? It was both terrifying and exhilarating. The view from the top was worth every bit of confusion and exhaustion. I hope this year brings you many more adventures like that one, filled with unexpected twists and beautiful surprises.

Video gaming has always been our go-to for a chill night in. Those late-night gaming sessions, full of laughter and friendly competition, are some of my favorite memories. May this year be filled with more epic gaming nights and high scores. Cheers to another fantastic year ahead!

Best regards,
Fatima

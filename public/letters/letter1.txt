Dear Casey,

Happy birthday. Remember that time we decided to hike up Dragon's Tooth and got hopelessly lost? It was like the real-life version of wandering through a dungeon without a map. Terrifying and exhilarating, sure. But mostly confusing. At least the view from the top was worth the blisters and our complete lack of direction. I hope this year brings you many more adventures, filled with unexpected twists and beautiful surprises—hopefully with better navigation.

Speaking of epic quests, I can’t help but think of our late-night watching-each other-game  marathons. Ah, the thrill of taking on a Dragon Priest with a hunting bow. 

Here's to another year of legendary adventures, dragon-slaying, and epic gaming nights. May your health bar always be full, and your glitches be few. Cheers.

It's a fine day with you around. Fus Ro Dah!

Hey Casey,

Happy Birthday! ðŸŽ‰ Remember our first international trip? Wandering around Istanbul like two clueless tourists and stuffing our faces with simit? Good times. And that time we almost got lost in the maze of Thessaloniki's streets â€“ I'm pretty sure we invented new Greek words out of frustration. Those adventures were bonkers fun.

Speaking of adventures, our turtle obsession has always cracked me up. Volunteering at that turtle rescue center was a blast, wasn't it? Watching those little guys waddle around, trying to convince them we were their long-lost relatives â€“ pure gold. Here's hoping your love for turtles keeps growing. Who knows, maybe one day you'll start that turtle commune.

Cheers and turtle power,
Guillermo

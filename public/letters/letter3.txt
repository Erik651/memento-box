Dear Casey,

Happy birthday! I still remember the excitement of our first international trip together. Navigating through foreign cities, trying new foods, and immersing ourselves in different cultures was an eye-opening experience. I hope you have many more opportunities to travel and discover the wonders of the world.

Our shared love for turtles has always been a special bond. Remember the time we volunteered at the turtle rescue center? It was amazing to see these incredible creatures up close and contribute to their conservation. May your passion for turtles continue to grow and inspire others.

Warm regards,
Guillermo

Dear Casey,

Wishing you a fantastic birthday! Our road trip last summer was unforgettable. From the spontaneous detours to the deep conversations during long drives, it was a journey I will always cherish. I hope this year gives you the chance to explore new places and create more wonderful memories on the road.

Gardening together in the community garden has been such a rewarding experience. Watching our plants grow and bloom has taught me so much about patience and care. I hope you continue to find joy and peace in your garden. Here's to many more sunny days spent among the flowers!

Sincerely,
Charlie

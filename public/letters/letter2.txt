Dear Casey,

Happy birthday, you old wanderer! Remember our road trip to the Great Smoky Mountains last summer? You know, the one where we ignored Google Maps and ended up in that ghost town? Ah, good times. Nothing like spontaneous detours and deep existential conversations to spice up a road trip. Here's hoping this year gives you more chances to get hilariously lost and make more bizarre memories.

Gardening together in the community plot has been a hoot. Who knew we had green thumbs? Watching our plants grow, despite our best efforts, has been a real lesson in patience and mild neglect. Keep finding that zen among the weeds and overgrown vegetables. Here’s to more sunny days spent swatting at bugs and pretending we know what we’re doing.

Cheers,
Charlie
